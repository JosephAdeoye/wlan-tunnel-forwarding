# Simple Topology with Layer 2 Tunnel Forwarding Configuration
This repository contains a simple network topology demonstrating the configuration of Layer 2 tunnel forwarding. The topology and configuration files showcase how to encapsulate and forward traffic using a centralized controller. This setup is commonly used in wireless networks to enable centralized management and control of traffic.

# Features

- Layer 2 Tunnel Forwarding: Demonstrates the use of tunneling protocols to forward traffic from access points (APs) to a central controller.

- Centralized Traffic Management: Shows how to configure a network where all traffic is processed and managed by a central controller, providing enhanced visibility and control.

- Sample Configuration Files: Includes configuration files for network devices (switches, routers, APs) to set up and enable Layer 2 tunnel forwarding.

- Network Topology Diagram: A visual representation of the network topology to help understand the setup and configuration steps.
